# Hello!

**I'm Joey** (they/he), a full-stack software developer with 10 years of experience across various fields, including JVM backend development, Jamstack web development, and UX design.

I have a passion for writing elegant, modular, and maintainable code which I pair with compelling designs to create the best possible user experience. One of my favorite hobbies is
to experiment with new, innovative technologies; my current focus is [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

Outside of development, I love to play RTS and 4X games and stare at my pet land snails.
