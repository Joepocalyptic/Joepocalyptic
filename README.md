# Hello!

**I'm Joey** (they/he), a software engineer with 12 years of experience across various fields, including full-stack web development, distributed systems engineering, embedded software engineering, cross-platform app development, Linux sysadmin, and UX design.

I have a passion for writing elegant, pragmatic, and maintainable code which I pair with compelling designs to create the best possible user experience. One of my favorite hobbies is
to experiment with new, innovative technologies; my current focus is [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

Outside of development, I love to play RTS and 4X games and stare at my pet land snails.
